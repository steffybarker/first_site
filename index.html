				Biography
			</h3>
			<p>
				My enthusiasm for tech and entrepreneurship has grown from working with start-ups and studying information systems and innovation. This is my first site on Code First: Girls. A scholarship programme for girls who want to build, hack, and disrupt. This page is for my thoughts on societal issues, and for me to listen to yours. So, speak up!
